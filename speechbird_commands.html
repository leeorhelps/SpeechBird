<tr><td>Press keyboard buttons</td><td>"a", "a", "c"... "capital A", "capital B", "capital C".<br><br>"2 down" presses down twice, "3 up" presses Up 3 times, etc.</td><td></td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Add punctuation intelligently (with automatic spacing)</td><td>"Comma", "Period", "Question Mark", etc.</td><td>You can also say "Press comma" to override the intelligent spacing, or to force typing in apps that do not support dictation.</td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Explicitly press number keys</td><td>"Akhat", "Shtaim", "Shalosh", "Arba", "Khamesh", "Shesh", "Sheva", "Shmoneh", "Tesha", "Effes". Or: say "Numeral" and then the numbers, eg "Numeral one two three".</td><td>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 Respectively, in Hebrew. Users may change these to a langugae of their choice, or "num 1", "num 2"... Or: Learn the useful nmes of 10 digits in Hebrew, it's not so hard!</td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Enter</td><td>"Enter" or "New Line"</td><td>Saying "Enter" mid-dictation will result in the word typed; "New Line" mid-dictation will insert a new line. Both can be incorporated in command streams, with or without a multiplier (eg "3 Enter")</td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Space</td><td>"Space"</td><td></td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Backspace</td><td>"Back"</td><td>"Back" deletes last letter. "Backs" deletes last word. "N Backs" deletes last N Words. "Nth Backs" deletes Nth word back. "SBack" deletes word under mouse pointer. "N SBack" deletes last N words, starting from mouse pointer. Note: Commands that manipulate whole words can be triggered when pointer is anywhere on the word, no need to aim precisely.</td><td>Streamable, Selecting, Multiplier, Ordinal, Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Delete</td><td>"Delete"</td><td>"Delete" deletes next letter. "Deletes" deletes next word. "N Deletes" deletes next N Words (same as "N AfterS, Delete"). "Nth Deletes" deletes Nth word forward. "SDelete" deletes word under mouse pointer. "N SDelete" deletes next N words, starting from mouse pointer.</td><td>Streamable, Selecting, Multiplier, Ordinal, Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Escape</td><td>"Cancel"</td><td>Small windows that pop on the screen can be closed with this command, whether they have a "cancel" button or not.</td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Move to next / previous form box or item</td><td>"Tab" / "Shiftab"</td><td>Also useful for indentation</td><td>Advanced, Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type special keys</td><td>"equals", "strudel" or "at sign", "minus" or "hyphen", "underscore", "plus", "percent sign", "parrens", "brackets", "braces", "greater than", "less than"</td><td></td><td>Streamable, Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Force pressing keyboard buttons</td><td>"Press a", "Press captial t h i s", "Press 3 2 1" "capital A", "capital B", "capital C". "PresseS <1 or more keys>" will replace last letter with those keys, "N PresseS" eg "3 PresseS <keys>" will replace last 3 letters, "Nth PresseS" eg "4th PresseS q u i e t" will replace 4th-previous letter.</td><td></td><td>Streamable, Selecting, multiplier, Ordinal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Force Typing mode for current phrase.</td><td>"Type <text>"</td><td>Useful for replacing text that is already selected, or by using "N TypeS <text>" to select and replace in one breath. Also useful for forcing words that are also a command to be interpreted as text, not a command, eg "type backspace". This command is streamable, but since it is followed by the text to type, can only come as the last command in a stream. Handles punctuation and capitalization smartly. "N TypeS <text>" eg "2 TypeS <text>" will overwrite last 2 words with <text>. "Nth TypeS <text>" will overwrite Nth previous word. "SType <text>" will overwrite word under mouse pointer, and "N Stype <text>" will overwrite N words, starting from the one under mouse pointer. Hint: To insert text under the current mouse position without overwriting, say "Yep Type <text>".</td><td>Streamable, Selecting, Multiplier, Ordinal, Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brute Force Typing mode for current phrase.</td><td>"Just Type <text>"</td><td>Same as "Type" <text>", but bypasses WSR's text interpretation engine, it JUST types by sending keyboard keys directly to any app. Useful for brute forcing text into apps that totally refuse dictation of a phrase, replacing text that is already selected, or by using "N Just TypeS <text>" to select and replace in one breath. Also useful for forcing words that are also a command to be interpreted as text, not a command, eg "just type backspace". This command is streamable, but since it is followed by the text to type, can only come as the last command in a stream. Ignores convention and handles punctuation and capitalization crudely. "N Just TypeS <text>" eg "2 Just TypeS <text>" will overwrite last 2 words with <text>. "Nth Just TypeS <text>" will overwrite Nth previous word. 	Attrib: Streamable, Selecting, Multiplier, Ordinal</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Open Scribble Box for single line of text</td><td>"Scribble" or "Scribble <text>"</td><td>(Requires setting up a simple shortcut to cmd.exe and adding its path to this Macro) Scribble allows you to quickly insert text into apps that do not support voice dictation. Useful when you want something quicker than "Dictate <text>", but still want more control than "Type <text>" or "Just Type <text>", eg when filling a form.</td><td>Streamable, Selecting, Multiplier, Ordinal, Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Open Dictation window for multiline or formatted text</td><td>"Dictate" or "Dictate <text>" or "Dictate Paste"</td><td>(Requires App: Outlook. Can be changed to rely on Word, or WordPad) Provides proper handling of formatting (bold, underline, fonts and sizes), as well as undo/redo, saving texts as drafts. Dictated text can be automatically inserted into other applications, even if they do not natively support voice dictation.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Finish dictating</td><td>"Soff"</td><td>When dictation window is open, this command will close the dictation window and paste dictated text into the previous window, ("Soff" is Hebrew for "End"). The dictated text is saved, in case the user wants to refer back to it or in case anything goes wrong with the pasting.</td><td></td></tr>

<tbody class="table-striped">
<tr><td>Click</td><td>"Yep" (OR: "Click That")</td><td>"Yep" for regular left click. "Yep" is not Multiplier, but "Syep" is Multiplier: "SYep" selects word under mouse (Same as saying "Click that. Select previous word."). "N SYep" Eg: "3 SYep" selects 3 befores, starting at mouse pointer. Yeps" selects text and images from current typing position to mouse pointer (Shift + Click).

<tr><td>Double Click</td><td>"Yeah" (OR: "Double Click That")</td><td>"Yeah" is not Multiplier, but the moused "SYeah" to select words is Multiplier. "N SYeah" eg "4 SYeah" clicks the mouse, goes to end of word and then select the last 4 words. This alternative to "SYep" works also in apps that are incompatible with Windows Speech Recognition. Tip: If you starting saying "Yep" and realise you still need to move the mouse a little bit to the item you wish to click, you can slur the "Yiiiiiieah".</td><td>Streamable, Selecting, Multiplier, Moused</td></tr>
