#### Description: SPEECHBIRD lets you do (nearly) everything on your computer, hands free.
SPEECHBIRD brings extra functionality to Speech Recognition, so you can operate your computer using **your voice** instead of your hands (but with speed! (and accuracy! (and sanity!))).

* Craft beautiful documents for business or school
* Write emails
* Browse the internet
* Play games
* Control any Windows application, and Windows operating system itself
* Write code
* Fully operate your computer!
If you want to do all this while using your keyboard or mouse less, or not at all: SPEECHBIRD is for you.

SPEECHBIRD is free software released under the GNU / GPL3 terms.

#### Key Details:
SPEECHBIRD comes with a set of 100's of new commands which simulate keyboard/mouse actions and direct control of applications and operating system functions. SPEECHBIRD commands are designed for a quick, accurate and pleasant voice control experience:
* Intuitive and memorable: "Bold" means bold ... "Copy" means copy. Easy, right?
* Fun, quick and low-effort to pronounce: "Yep" replaces WSR's tedious and boring "Click that". Say "Click that" out loud as many times as you clicked your mouse in the last hour... Now, try "Yep".
* Logical and modular: When you learn a new SPEECHBIRD command, you actually learn a powerful piece of logic that applies everywhere, giving you access to many other new commands. Example: Adding an "s" to editing commands will automatically select the previous word(s), and apply an editing action to them. Other Speech Recognition solutions require you to say "select last word" (or: "select last 3 words"), and then the user can say "Cut" or "Copy", etc. With SPEECHBIRD, "Cuts" will select and cut the previous word. Saying "Cuts 3" will cut the last words. Having learned this piece, you can fly with all editing commands, such as "Bolds 5" (Make last 5 words bold), "Underlines" (Underline last word), "Copys 2" (Copy last 2 words), etc.
* Reduction of misrecognitions: Similar-sounding words have been avoided when choosing words for voice commands.

SPEECHBIRD adds **Command Streaming** capability. Without SPEECHBIRD, you have to pause after speaking each voice command to allow the computer to perform it:
"Select last 4 words" (pause...) "Copy" (pause...) "Press up 3 times" (pause...) "Select next 2 words" (pause...) "Paste" (pause...).
With SPEECHBIRD's Command Streaming, you can say it all in one breath: "Copys 4, up 3, pastes 2" -- Done!
(v0.4 and up. Previous versions use "4 Copys, 3 Up, 2 Pastes")
