## Why SpeechBird?
Existing voice support on Windows and OS X falls short when it comes to real world computer use – frustrating, slow, inaccurate. Dictation works well - but users need more. SpeechBirds provides:
* Fully hands-free mouse! SpeechBird integrates with Enable ViaCam + AHK, no additional hardware needed.

* Command Streaming: Issue several commands at once, without having to wait in between.

* Beyond dictation: Easily bring your ideas and documents from "Draft" to "Final" with intelligent voice-editing commands.

* SpeechBird's commands are easy, so you can focus and get stuff done.

* Do everything on MS-Windows, hands-free: Browse websites and fill forms. Write emails and documents. Navigate and control files and folders. Etc.
