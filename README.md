Requirements: MS-Windows. Your voice. That’s all.
Users who are able can use head-movement for mouse pointer control. 

## Why SpeechBird?
Existing voice support on Windows and OS X falls short when it comes to real world computer use – frustrating, slow, and inaccurate. Dictation works well - but users need more. With SpeechBird, they can have real hands-free control:
* Full editing functionality, from instant  selection of letters/words/pages thru corrections and formatting. 

* Command streaming, so you don’t need to wait for each command to execute before issuing the next one

* Intuitive commands that are easy to remember and pronounce.

* Highly customizable. 

* Designed for everyday tasks: Using websites and filling forms. Writing emails, documents and spreadsheets. Controlling files and folders.

* …and everything on MS-Windows.
