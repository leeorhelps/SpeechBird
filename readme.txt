Speech Bird instantly chops your speeches to bite-size, and performs the commands one by one. Want to edit documents and control software hands-free? Speech Bird gives WSR wings with its nest-full of new commands and enhancements to WSR's built-ins.

Preflight Checklist:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[] Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) - REQUIRED. Windows built-in. Free. Just turn it on!

[] WSR Macros - REQUIRED. Download free. Makes WSR capable of talking with Speech Bird!
A bit tricky, since MS has removed from their website. But you can get it here:
https://windows-speech-recognition-macros.software.informer.com/download/
If you have concerns, you can download the .MSI file, and then upload it to www.virustotal.com for testing before running the installer.

[] AutoHotKey - RECOMMENDED - Needed just for "Drag" & "Drop" commands, and derivatives like "Drag Back" (and "Dragger") which drag what's under the mouse cursor for dropping into the previous active app, (or to any running app).

[] enable ViaCam - OPTIONAL. Makes your webcam track your face instead of a mouse. Speech Bird plays well with eViaCam, and includes some commands.

[] Microsoft Power Toys - OPTIONAL - Used to provide visual feedback of mouse click events and their precise location, if you enable Power Toys' "Mouse Highlighter" functions.
