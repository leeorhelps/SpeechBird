         SPEECH BIRD v0.2 (May 2022)  |  (c) 2022 by Leeor Peled  |  speak2computer@gmail.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ladies and gentlemen, meet Speech Bird: A speech recognition dialect which makes controlling your computer hands-free truly possible, fast, and fun. You can dictate texts, manipulate them and perform all keyboard/mouse actions with just your voice, and head movements.

Speech bird does this by:

* Adding several hundred much-needed commands to Microsoft Windows Speech Recognition (WSR), so you can perform day-to-day office work such as writing, editing and formating documents, browsing the web, writing emails -- without WSR's native clunkiness, and with speed! 

* Adding voice capabilities to several extremely handy apps (listed below), which do not have native voice control.

* Integrating those separate, handy apps into one, unified voice control system. Speech Bird makes the underlying apps work together seamlessly. 

* Augmenting WSR with Command Streaming. No more ruffled feathers from waiting for WSR between commands - With Speech Bird, you can speak a few commands in one shot, or even mix text-dictation and voice-commands within statements. Speech Bird instantly chops your speeches to bite-size, and performs the commands one by one.

* Enabling direct keyboard keys.

* And more! See dictionary.txt for complete list of possible commands. Note: Speech Bird ADDS to WSR, but all native WSR commands work normally with it -- except a few cases, for example saying "start" types the word rather than clicking the start button, because that is what most humans want their computer to do when they say "start".
