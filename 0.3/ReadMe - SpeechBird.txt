Ladies and gentlemen, meet SpeechBird: A hands-free computer-control system.

Several applications handle dictation – virtual typing of texts by speech recognition. Speech recognition based commands, on the other hand, are handled quite clumsily by existing software, and in some cases, not at all. Applications that claim to handle everyday actions – such as editing and formatting text, clicking buttons and browsing the Internet – do so only in part, using cumbersome commands, making them slow and distracting.

SpeechBird is designed to fix all that. You can think of SpeechBird as your personal secretary, like Miss Layton, who faithfully typed out Winston Churchill's letters and speeches for him. And, she used her brain, and was much more than just a typist. Like a secretary's shorthand, SpeechBird has its own dialect, which is easy to learn and means you can speak less to do more. It helps eliminate misrecognitions and reduces cognitive load required for voice control, so you can focus on what you want to do. 

SpeechBird helps determine whether what you say is dictation, to be typed; or actions, to be performed. It also adds features like Command Streaming, which overcomes the need to pause after each command – allowing you to speak several commands "in one shot", for example the selection of the last 3 sentences + cutting + moving the cursor down 4 lines + pasting – can not only be done by speaking separate commands – but with SpeechBird, it can also be done without pausing between commands, by speaking one "stream". In SpeechBird's dialect, that would be "3 sentences, cut, 4 down, paste", in case you are curious. You could even say "bold" at the end, if you wanted to.

SpeechBird is open source, free to use and share – and even modify by customizing existing commands or adding new ones to your heart's content. It requires WSR (Microsoft's Windows Speech Recognition) and several other applications – all of which are freely available online. SpeechBird takes care of orchestrating everything – first by understanding you, and then by sending the appropriate commands to each of the components. So, once everything is installed you do not need to think about all the individual components. Speak the text you want typed the and / or commands you want performed, and SpeechBird will make sure your computer understands.

Your thoughts and ideas for future versions are welcome. I hope you enjoy reading The Flying Manual and have a nice flight with your own, personal SpeechBird!
