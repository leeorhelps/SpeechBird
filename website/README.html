<h2 id="why-speechbird-">Why SpeechBird?</h2>
<p>Existing voice support on Windows and OS X falls short when it comes to real world computer use – frustrating, slow, inaccurate. Dictation works well - but users need more.</p>
<p>SpeechBird provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fully hands-free mouse! SpeechBird integrates with Enable ViaCam + AHK, no additional hardware needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Command Streaming: Issue several commands at once, without having to wait in between.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Beyond dictation: Easily bring your ideas and documents from &quot;Draft&quot; to &quot;Final&quot; with intelligent voice-editing commands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SpeechBird&#39;s commands are easy, so you can focus and get stuff done.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do everything on MS-Windows, hands-free: Browse websites and fill forms. Write emails and documents. Navigate and control files and folders. Etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
