<tbody class="table-striped">
<tr><td>Press Arrow Keys</td><td>"Up" / "Down" / "Left" / "Right"</td><td>"Streamable" attribute means you can say this command along with other commands in one breath, e.g:<br>"Up Right Up Space Right" <br><br>"Multiplier" attribute means you can say any number 1-10 e.g: "3 Down" (instead of "Down" "Down" "Down")<br><br>You may combine attributes, e.g:<br>"3 Down 5 Right Space 7 RightS" in one breath, without having to pause your stream of commands.<br><br>"Selecting" attribute means you can add "S" at the end to select while moving, e.g:<br>"3 RightS" will select 3 lettrs to the right.<br><br>"Ordinals" is possible when Selecting. "Nth LeftS/RightS" selects a letter e.g: "4th LeftS" to select 4th letter to the left. "Nth UpS/DownS" selects a line.<br><br>"Big" attribute means you can say "Big" first to move by whole words, e.g:<br>"2 Big Right" moves right by 2 words, "Big LeftS" selects to word-start, "Big RightS" selects to word-end.</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier<br>Selecting<br>ordinal<br>Big</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Alphabet Keys</td><td>"a", "b", "c"...<br>"capital A", "capital B"...</td><td>SpeechBird defaults to typing when 1-3 letters are spoken. Even if text is selected, it will be overwritten (rather than bringing up the Alternates Panel for a correction).<br><br>To type longer sequences of letters, first say "Press", e.g:<br>"Press a b c captial d captial e..."</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Add Punctuation <strong>intelligently</strong><br>(Auto spacing)</td><td>"Comma", "Period", "Question Mark", "Exclamation Mark", etc.</td><td>To override intelligent typing, first say "Press".</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press One or More Number Keys</td><td>"Numeral (numbers)"</td><td>"Stream Ender" attribute means other commands can be spoken before this command, but after this command only numbers (even many numbers) can be spoken in the same breath.<br><br>"Numeral One" or "Numeral One Two Three" or "Numeral Three Hundred And Six" or "Numeral Three Two Six Ten"</td><td>Stream Ender</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press a Number Key</td><td>"Akhat", "Shtaim", "Shalosh", "Arba", "Khamesh", "Shesh", "Sheva", "Shmoneh", "Tesha", "Effes".</td><td>"Streamable" attribute means this command (10 separate commands, actually) are fully Streamable.<br><br>These words mean 1, 2, 3...0 in Hebrew.<br><br>You can change these quick-keypress commands to your langugae of choice, or use English by appending "num 1", "num 2" to distinguish them from When you are multiplying commands (e.g. "2 Down" should press down twice, not type the word "Two").<br><br>Important! Changing this from Hebrew requires changing directly within SpeerchBird's WSRMac file.<br>Or: Learn 10 digits in Hebrew, it's not so hard, and very useful!</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Enter</td><td>"Enter" or "New Line"</td><td>Saying "Enter" mid-dictation will result in the word "enter" typed; "New Line" mid-dictation will insert a new line. In command streams, both statements will be interpreted as pressing Enter.</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Space</td><td>"Space"</td><td></td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Backspace</td><td>"Back"</td><td>"Back" deletes last letter.<br><br>"Selecting" attribute means you can say "BackS" to select and delete last word.<br><br>"Multiplier" attribute means "N BackS" selects and deletes last N words.<br><br>"Ordinal" Attribute means "Nth Down go before down go before BackS" selects and deletes Nth-previous word.<br><br>"Moused" Attribute means "SBack" clicks the mouse, then delets previous word. Effectively deletes word under mouse pointer (Think of Moused commands as telling SpeechBird: "This:" + Command).<br><br>Combining the above, saying "N SBack" clicks and deletes N-previous words, e.g:<br>"3 SBack" deletes 3 words, starting from mouse pointer.<br><br>Note: Commands that apply to all words such as "BackS", "DeleteS", "BoldS" can be spoken anywhere in a word (no need to aim precisely for a specific part of the word).</td><td>Streamable<br>Selecting<br>Multiplier<br>Ordinal<br>Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Delete</td><td>"Delete"</td><td>Same as "Back", but in the opposite direction.</td><td>Streamable<br>Selecting<br>Multiplier<br>Ordinal<br>Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Escape</td><td>"Cancel"</td><td>Hint: Useful for closing popup windows, whether they have a "cancel" button or not.</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press Tab / Shift Tab</td><td>"Tab" / "Shiftab"</td><td>Move to next / previous form box or item; In MS Word and other text editors: Indentation</td><td>Advanced<br>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Press special keys</td><td>"Equals", "Strudel" Or "At Sign", "Minus" Or "Hyphen", "Underscore", "Plus", "Percent Sign", "Open/Close Parren", "Open/Close Bracket", "Open/Close Brace", "Greater Than", "Less Than"</td><td>To instantly <strong> open </strong> and <strong> close </strong> and <strong> press left </strong> in one breath, say "Parentheses", "Brackets" or "Braces".<br><br>For instant addition of parentheses (or quotes) around existing text, see "Parren" and "Quote" (these two special key commands have "Selecting" ("ParrenS"), "Multiplier" ("3 ParrenS") and "Moused" ("3 SParren") attributes).</td><td>Streamable<br>Multiplier</td></tr>
<tr><td>Force pressing keyboard buttons</td><td>"Press (keys)"<br>e.g. "Press D O G S"</td><td>"Stream Ender" attribute: This command is streamable, but when streamed together with other commands, it can only come as the last command in a stream (otherwise the computer would not know whether "press two down" means to press 2 and then press down, or to press down 2 times).<br><br>"Selecting" and "Multiplier" attributes means "3 Presses z" will select the last 3 letters and replace them with "z" and "2 Presses C A T S" will replace the last 2 letters with "cats".<br><br>"Ordinals" attribute means "Nth PresseS (keys)" will replace Nth-previous letter with the spoken keys, e.g. eg "4th PresseS q u i e t".<br><br>Works even in applications that are not compatible with speech recognition / dictation.</td><td>Stream Ender<br>Selecting<br>Multiplier<br>Ordinal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Force Typing mode for current phrase.</td><td>"Type (text)"</td><td>"Stream Ender" attribute: This command is streamable, but when streamed together with other commands, it can only come as the last command in a stream, e.g:<br>"3 Up 2 AfterS Type up up and away" will:<br>Press Up 3 times, select 2 next words, and type 'up up and away' (replacing those 2 selected words).<br><br>"Type" is useful for replacing text that is already selected (Instead of bringing up the Alternates Panel).<br><br>"N TypeS (text)" to select the last N words and replace them in one breath.<br><br>Useful for forcing dictation-mode for a breath that only contains words that are normally commands, e.g. "Type back" if you want to dictate just the word "back" without any other text, and want to be sure SpeechBird won't interpret that as pressing the Backspace key.<br><br>Examples:<br>"N TypeS <text>" e.g:<br>"2 TypeS <text>" will overwrite last 2 words with <text>.<br><br>"Nth TypeS <text>" will overwrite Nth previous word.<br><br>"SType <text>" will overwrite word under mouse pointer.<br><br>"N Stype <text>" will overwrite N words, starting from the one under mouse pointer.<br>Hint: To insert text under the current mouse position without overwriting, say "Yep Type <text>".</td><td>Stream Ender<br>Selecting<br>Multiplier<br>Ordinal<br>Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Just type text</td><td>"Just Type (text)"</td><td>"Stream Ender" attribute: This command is streamable, but when streamed together with other commands, it can only come as the last command in a stream since any subsequent commands spoken in same breath will be typed out as words rather than executed.<br><br>"Selecting" attribute means adding "S" will select the previous word, and Just Type over it.<br>"Multiplier" attribute means you can overwrite mulitple words e.g: "4 Just TypeS that's nice!" will replace the last 4 words with "that's nice!"<br>"Ordinal" attribute means you can select a specific last-word to overwrite, e.g: "3rd Just TypeS I like that" will replace the 3rd-last-word with "I like that".<br><br>Hints:<br>"Just Type" is similar to "Type" <text>", but bypasses WSR's regular dictation engine, meaning:<br><br>(A) Even if current app normally doesn't support dictation, you can "Just Type" into it!<br>(B) If text is selected, it will be replaced with the "Just Type"d text<br>(C) Will "Just Type", even when speaking a phrase that would normally be a command (e.g: "Just Type 3 Right" will just type "three right", those words, rather than the usual execution, which would be to press the Right Arrow key three times).<br>(D) "Just Type" handles punctuation and capitalization crudely (unlike "Type", which uses WSR's dictation engine), but "Just Type" works anywhere, including where "Type" and any WSR dictation does not.</td><td>Stream Ender, Selecting, Multiplier, Ordinal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Open Scribble Box</td><td>"Scribble" or "Scribble <text>"</td><td>"Scribble Box" (an upgrade of WSR's built-in mini "Dictation Box") allows quick creation and editing of text, primarily for inserting text into apps that do not support voice dictation.<br><br>Similar to "Dictate <text>" (see below), less robust but quicker.</td><td>Stream Ender<br>Selecting<br>Multiplier<br>Ordinal<br>Moused</td></tr>
<tr><td>Open Dictation window for multiline or formatted text</td><td>"Dictate" or "Dictate <text>" or "Dictate Paste"</td><td>Like "Scribble Box", allows creation and editing of text with full control over font sizes, bold / underline, colors, images, etc. Useful primarily for creating text to insert into apps that do not support voice dictation and also handy for saving quick notes.<br><br>Requires an App that does handle dictation well (default is Outlook. Word, WordPad and Notpad also work, but Outlook works best in terms of full editing, undo/redo, saving as draft or directly sending as an email).<br><br>Hint: "Scribble" Changes clipboard contents. It is highly recommended to enable Windows Clipboard History, so you can still refer to other rentely copied texts and images.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Finish dictating</td><td>"Soff"</td><td>Close the dictation window and paste dictated text into the previous window, ("Soff" is Hebrew for "End"). Dictated text is saved the clipboard, and to hard drive as a file (or a draft, if using outlook), allowing the user to refer back to it or in case anything goes wrong with the pasting.</td><td></td></tr>
